    "1. Supervised learning: \n",
    "    - we train the program on previously known (labelled) data\n",
    "    - after training, we except it to make predictions on new data\n",
    "    - ex: regression, classification\n",
    "2. Unsupervised learning:\n",
    "    - we leave the program to find patterns in data\n",
    "    - ex: clustering analysis, dimensionality reduction\n",
    "3. Reinforcement learning:\n",
    "    - a form of supervised learning\n",
    "    - the program learns continuously\n",
